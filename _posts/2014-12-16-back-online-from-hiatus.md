title: Back Online After Hiatus
---

My bots went through a bit of a perfect storm of unfortunate events.  When the client finally went from Beta to mainstream everything was working fairly well.  Then they released a bunch of updates to the ways trades and trade windows are shown up on the screen. This of course managed to break my bot but not in such a way that they wouldn't run.  However, they did fail more than they would succeed and that was unacceptable for me so I took them offline.

Then I got offered a new job opportunity.  Because of this I wasn't able to spend the quality time I needed to fix my bot code.  Currently our work is on a somewhat hiatus for the holiday season so I've had an opporunity to finally get around to fixing my bots.

I'm very happy with my changes for my first pass.  I haven't gotten around to fixing other pieces of the code that are broken due to the trade changes like the Transfers between my bots or iterating over the cards I want to purchase.  But these should hopefully work themselves out now that I have fixed the initial trade view.
