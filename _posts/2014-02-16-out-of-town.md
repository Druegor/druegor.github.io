Out of town for a few days
===
I have to leave town for a few days to do some goodwill work in another country.  So I've decided I'll just leave my bots online and let them either run out of money or cause the client to crash.

However, I'd like to take a second to give a huge thanks to Jesse Reeves without whom I would not have been able to resolve some of the key issues that were causing my bot to unsuccessfully trade for the last day.

Hopefully if anyone is reading this you will take advantage of this time to use my bots and see what process you like or don't like about its operation.  Feel free to give me feedback the bot is still very much an in progress work.

Initially I listed the full value of your account when you logged in, or at least the value of the cards visible for trade.  I felt this was causing some confusion as to why I didn't want to buy the cards available for trade since there is a max limit.  It also caused considerable slow down since scrolling through the entire list of the large card sets and getting the appropriate screen values is not free.  However, I'm trying to put a price checker on the site so you can upload a deck file or collection file and get the value of your cards from me as a buyer.

Thanks, Management
