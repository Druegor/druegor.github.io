Bad User Experiences
===
I want to apologize for some of the bad user experiences that you guys have had using my bots thus far.  As I mentioned I wrote this in a little under five days while working full time.  So my quality control in a few areas is somewhat lacking.

<!--more-->

  - Logging:  If you are force to write your own version of logging from some reason keep in mind that multiple threads will cause a locking issue (took two days to figure this out which is why my bot kept puking)
  -  Timing:  Its really hard to decide what an appropriate user experience is with timing.  While at the same time not overloading the application with hundreds of calls a second to try to add / remove cards from the collection panes.  It's also hard to determine if I've already clicked on a card to return it back and forth if the application is running slow so I constantly have to keep track of my clicks and poll the screen areas.
  -  My communication skills are lacking with this application.  It seems to be very difficult to communicate that the bot acts after you take the first ticket/card.  So I see people typing in the chat window since I think they are used to having the bots respond to chat commands rather than just responding to their interaction with the client.
      - Along the same lines people are not used to just submitting their trades when they are done which hopefully I can reteach.

If you are having a bad experience with the bots please leave me a comment about what happened and I will do everything I can to make it a better experience and reward you with credits towards future trades to try and incentive your future business.

Feel free to try your best to steal my money and cause my bot to shut down since you might get something out of it either way if you can tell me the process you went through.

Thanks, Management
