Silent much!?
==

I've been a little off the radar for a while in regards to my automated bot project.  I've decided to put up what I worked on in [Github][1] with the hopes that someone else can improve upon my initial code.  Also it seems like a bit of a waste to spend a lot of time on this project and then not have anything to show for it.  

Right now I'm not a 100% sure that the code will compile right now.  I was in the process of moving towards doing all the data driven functionality in dapper and using ServiceStack apis for the data back and forth.

I would like to get back into working on this project.   However, I'm a little tired of working on this alone.  So as I said I'm throwing this code out in the wild with the hope that people will work on branches and make formal pull requests to add functionality that is missing.  

Why I stopped
--
I learned a lesson the hard way about doing backups to offsite storage.  I managed to lose all my personal projects, at least the databases that I had been using for the last few years.  After I lost all my historical data for screen positions, colors, cards, prices and credits I just lost all of my motivation.  Not only did I lose my motivation at this time I had to replace all my hardware which wasn't cheap so I sold my online collections after I had redeemed what I could.   Without my data and without my collection it seemed less than worthwhile to keep working on this code.
